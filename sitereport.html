        <article>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Creating my website was a journey filled with excitement and challenges. Initially, I was eager to design a site that would reflect my unique style and skills. However, as I examined into the task, I quickly encountered the complexities of coding and ensuring everything worked smoothly. Dealing with bugs and technical issues tested my patience, but each problem I solved taught me something new about web development. My focus shifted towards creating a design that was user-friendly and accessible across different devices, aiming for easy navigation and a visually appealing layout. Despite the challenges, overcoming each obstacle gave me a sense of accomplishment and improved my abilities significantly.</p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Ultimately, my portfolio website serves as an online showcase of my skills and capabilities. It typically includes sections like an introduction or about me, a gallery showcasing my projects, and contact information for potential collaborations or inquiries. Drawing inspiration from the sky, I opted for a simple yet classic sky blue color scheme for the website, aiming to create a clean and professional look. My brother's impressive design work also inspired me, pushing me to strive for the same level of quality and creativity in my own portfolio.</p>
