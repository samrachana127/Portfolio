        <article>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Creating my website was a journey filled with excitement and challenges. Initially, I was eager to design a site that would reflect my unique style and skills. However, as I examined into the task, I quickly encountered the complexities of coding and ensuring everything worked smoothly. Dealing with bugs and technical issues tested my patience, but each problem I solved taught me something new about web development. My focus shifted towards creating a design that was user-friendly and accessible across different devices, aiming for easy navigation and a visually appealing layout.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>Ultimately, my portfolio website serves as an online showcase of my skills and capabilities. It typically includes sections like an introduction or about me, a gallery showcasing my projects, and contact information for potential collaborations or inquiries. Drawing inspiration from the sky, I opted for a simple yet classic sky blue color scheme for the website, aiming to create a clean and professional look. My brother's impressive design work also inspired me, pushing me to strive for the same level of quality and creativity in my own portfolio.</p>

           <p>Contact: Here's where people can easily get in touch with me. It's like having a direct line for potential clients or collaborators to reach out. I provide a form where they can leave their details and message me directly.</p>

           <p>Video Demo: In this section, I show videos that demonstrate my work in action. It's like bringing my projects to life visually, so visitors can see exactly what I'm capable of and how my work looks in real scenarios.</p>

           <p>Site Report: This section gives me insights into how my website is performing.
